## About the project

This project is about creating a terrestrial simulation followed by a hydrodynamic one.
At first, you will extrapolate a surface from the very restricted provided data
to represent a scene. Once that scene is defined, it will be covered with
water, in multiple shapes.

Your program will get at least one external file (extensions .mod1) as parameter that
contains the minimum information you have at your disposal. It is a series of coordinates
in 3D. They define a few sparse points through which your scene will imperatively go
across. It can be either 5, 10 or 20 points for example. A file containing more than 50
points is off topic. This is not about creating a fdf all over again.
